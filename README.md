# TechEdProjects

Requirements acheived:

Added sections including a header and footer to give the webpage structure.

Added background images via CSS.

Gave both the title class and the dark mode button absolute positioning.

I first tried to replicate the website through my own observation but then used developer tools and inspect when requiring assistance.

I also relied on the website W3Schools.

I wanted to use javascript to change the images to hidden so as to leave a white background as the site's light mode, but I wasn't sure how to target the visibility within a class. I will work on this for future.

I attempted the stretch goal of adding audio via javascript but only to partial success. This and my aforementioned issue with javascript tell me that I am not yet confident in the coding language and need more practice, or to ask someone to talk through the syntax with me.
